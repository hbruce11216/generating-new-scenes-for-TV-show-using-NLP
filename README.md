# generating-new-scenes-for-TV-show-using-NLP
This is my rather silly introduction to learning NLP. I think the show "Rick and Morty" is hilarious, so I trained a model to read every script from the show's 3 seasons and then had it generate new lines in the voice of specific characters. At the bottom of this file I have demonstrated 4 new lines for Rick because he is my favorite character, but the model is designed so that every character had a trained model, meaning a new line could be generated for any of the characters, in their voice.
