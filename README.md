# generating-new-scenes-for-TV-show-using-NLP
This is my rather silly introduction to learning NLP. I think the show "Rick and Morty" is hilarious, so I trained a model to read every script from the show's 3 seasons and then had it generate new lines in the voice of specific characters. Because Rick is my favorite character, at the bottom of the file I have demonstrated 4 new lines for him, but the model is designed so that a model trained on every character's lines so that new speeches could be generated for any of the characters, in their voice.

Check out the "Rick and Morty - NLP.ipynb" for details.
