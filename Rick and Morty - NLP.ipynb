    "This is my rather silly introduction to learning NLP. I think the show \"Rick and Morty\" is hilarious, so I trained a model to read every script from the show's 3 seasons and then had it generate new lines in the voice of specific characters. At the bottom of this file I have demonstrated 4 new lines for Rick because he is my favorite character, but the model is designed so that every character had a trained model, meaning a new line could be generated for any of the characters, in their voice.

      "{'Morty': ' Then why aren\\'t we killing them?! Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake!They\\'re first line of defense against evil!They\\'re the guardians of the unguarded! I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.[holds up a \"Morty Adventure Card\" with ten squares and all but one containing a Morty-shaped stamp mark] Read \\'em and weep. Rick! Rick, stop! Whoa, yeah! You mean \"two for two\", right, Vance? So, this is... Vindicators 3?And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us? We weren\\'t here \"last time\", remember?They did a whole Vindicators without us.A bunch of them got killed, too.Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there. I... think the personality conflict might have been... you. Rick, since it\\'s my adventure and all, could you do me a favor? Rick, this really bums me out.It-It\\'s embarrassing to find out these guys don\\'t like us. Yeah, but not heroes. [sigh] I-I totally get it.I-I\\'m so sorry. [tongue-tied] I-I-I...I\\'m not a superhero. Rick says \"good\" and \"bad\" are artificial constructs. [annoyed] Get it yourself. Just focus on the mission, all right? Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender!We can\\'t leave now! Guys![finishes placing the cards underneath the pictures] I\\'ve figured it out. That\\'s not the issue, Rick! Uh, what happened on Dorian 5? W-Wait, huh? [with annoyed realization] Oh, o-okay.This again? I-It\\'s just something Rick starts talking about whenever he\\'s blackout drunk. In a way that has no point!You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out! [sigh] You guys hit the baskets.I\\'ll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.There\\'s a 40% chance it\\'s a dud, but y-you should still stay back. [angrily] Too many, Rick!Too many! You always put it in the weirdest place!Um, uh, over here, maybe? Oh, I don\\'t know.I appreciate it, Morty.I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators\\' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit. Yeah, it is.You know why, Rick?Because when you\\'re an asshole, it doesn\\'t matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction. [with realization] Holy shit.You\\'re jealous.Is that what you want to hear?! Guys, stop!You\\'re just proving my asshole grandpa right! I think... no matter what we put on there, we die.he said it\\'s the part of the Vindicators he values.That means nothing.He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave. What? [smiling smuglystarting walking toward the platform] I\\'ll cover that bet.I get it. [getting angry] ...Motherfucker! Shut up. [gagging] Greater good?! Never said that! No doubt.Who do we make the check out to? Right? But.. she was trying to kill us! Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom.Which is why we don\\'t need jackets.[takes his jacket off] And I\\'m pretty sure we don\\'t need Vindicators.', 'Rick': ' Great.Next time I need a species sterilized, who\\'s gonna do it for me?You?I-Is that the Vindibeacon?We\\'re being called to assemble by the Vindicators! I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty.Let it go to voicemail! They\\'re the writers of their own press releases, Morty!They\\'re a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up.They\\'re a phase.We did one, it was the big event of that summer.Let it die. God... fuckin\\' dammit![takes the card] Fine!But don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.[presses a button on the Vindibeacon and speaks into it] Vindicator command ship, beacon received!We\\'re doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm. Oh, that\\'s Million Ants.I can\\'t see the ants over here.It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man.Wiggly Turd Man. Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.[points to Crocubot] Um, this guy.The, uh... [laughs] Right, Crocubot.So, you\\'re half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine. So, you\\'re origin is what?Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy? Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses.Ability to do anything...But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me. Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman.After his parents\\' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains.It\\'s not all bad, though.They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle! Thanks, Noob-Noob!This guy gets it.It was happy hour. Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause. Did he say he never forgets a kid? Don\\'t worry, Morty, they love you.Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it\\'s mind-blowing. [spits] Jesus... How awesome is that?I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back? Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty.Me sleeping on these linens is the favor.I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating?Comfort? Why?Morty, [burp] I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week. Oh, please.They\\'re my heroes!Mine!I\\'m gonna go get a drink.Ship has arrived at Terraneus system.All Vindicators report to the... briefing room.The--The room from the, uh... the...Uh, it\\'s the d--It\\'s a different room than--than... conference room.I\\'m sorry, it\\'s my first day as a PA system.First day jitters. Barely. Uh-huh. Hey, I can\\'t help if I can\\'t see. Really?You don\\'t say.You would have used a ghost train?[sarcastic] Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train! Is there coffee?Hey, Morty, can you be a pal?Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship.Y-You know, the French press thing? [sarcastic] Oh, oh, oh, I\\'m sorry.Oh, you\\'re right.Ooh, real serious.Gotta take it real serious, huh?They\\'re all dead! [still sarcastic] Ooh, real scared.Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here. Million Ants, ladies and gentleman!The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!Short mission, good mission.Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train?See you guys in Vindicators 4.Morty? Well, have fun with that.But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour. Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout. Look, I\\'m a lit--[burp] little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I\\'ve always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours. Morty I\\'m a drunk, not a hack. [embarrassed] Well, I-I-I think we\\'ve seen enough.I\\'ll just figure out how to unplug this.The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves?Do you know yourselves?Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it\\'s a matching thing.And do it in three minutes, or you\\'ll [burp] all die.I\\'m not playing his game.I\\'m gonna find us a way out of here. Whoa, whoa, whoa.Hold on, Vance.He said you\\'d die if you tried to leave.That means there\\'s booby traps. What part of \"blackout\" don\\'t you understand?I thought you drank? Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh. Alan, I\\'m not proud of what\\'s happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there\\'s gonna be another passenger on that ghost train. Uh, I kind of am.I saved the goddamn universe. Ahh, it would\\'ve been if I hadn\\'t.Dorian 5! W-What?In w--In w-w-what--In what way?Like, w-w-what\\'s my point? So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place. I don\\'t either.You do you.But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.[cough] I\\'m so fucking drunk.Ugh, okay, here\\'s the deal.I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit.I\\'m--I\\'m not going to sleep.I just... just need to rest my eye, so let\\'s make this one simple.Just try to hit some three-pointers.And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something.Also, Hawaii. Man, I am really getting high-roaded today. Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb.it\\'s a miracle I actually every destroy anything. I know.Everyone wants people they like to be right.That\\'s why popular people are fucking dumb.And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.[the bomb powers down] Disarmed. Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.But... you do have one thing I\\'ll never have.And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me.if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode.And probably the solar system, \\'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one. I could--It could be Morty. Hey, I don\\'t know.I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there\\'s no logic to it.it\\'s, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying \"Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I\\'ll kill you.\" Look, I... there\\'s nothing in the room but us.I\\'m just using logic to connect some dots.It\\'s the best guess I\\'ve got. Well, Morty, I think you\\'re making that smirky face because you\\'re misinterpreting the moment.I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.It looks like I\\'m never gonna see you again.I can\\'t really roll with the hero types, and I don\\'t... th-they don\\'t want me around.But I want... you to know, even if I didn\\'t show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.It makes no sense.Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass.Even my own grandson is like, \"Oh, the Vindicators are so cool.\"I mean, he\\'s a moron, it\\'s their... demographic.But you\\'re different, Noob-Noob. [also gagging] Titty-Bean? [sarcastic] Yeah, I feel safer already. I\\'ll say, we are gettin\\' some good licks in while choking to death. Ah, who cares? Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week.I end up getting high with half of \\'em.I mean, check it out, Gear Head\\'s here.Well, that\\'s gonna shoot through me. Shut up, Summer. Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?', 'Supernova': \" ...the Terraneus system.Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base. Rick, you have something to add to the briefing? Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing![to Rick] If I can continue, Rick.I anticipate sophisticated security measures.I trust you can be of service there. Good morning.Looks like your grandpa had a long night.Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can... [sigh] clean up his diarrhea. Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission. Vindicators, prepare for arrival. Star Mother, grant me your wrath![goes back and faces the team] Gun turret. Are you all right? Someone wake up Sanchez. Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret.Can you bring it offline? RICK! It's Worldender!What happened to him? He's right.This is far from over. Obviously?You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it?That's something obvious to you? Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.Then, we'll deal with the two of you.[to Rick] I hope you're proud of yourself! Goddammit! Nothing! Doomnomitron was hiding here!He's a shapeshifter!Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him! I'm not the one that didn't want you back.Alan was! [growing sad] You wish this was about sex!We loved each other!We had a child together. [crying] I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR!And yes, he was better than you! Is that sarcasm?![conjures handcuffs onto Rick and Morty] I don't want you slipping away then this is over!All of these deaths are on your hands! So what's the trick?Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert. Jesus!Okay, open to second opinions! But you're betting our lives on it. Not all of us. Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles.It's for the greater good. It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure! You were always the romantic.[sinister] Which is why you can't leave either.She double-crossed Snuzzles!\", 'The, uh...\\nCrocubot': ' I am Crocubot.', 'Crocubot': \" Yes. Why would Worldender do this to his own men... and several women?

[slips on some diarrhea] Ohh!No, uh, I...I got stuff to do here.', 'Alan': ' I wish he had the ability to check is attitude. I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back! Nothing?!We exterminated a planet! Nice shot. You two make quite a team. Yeah, I guess. [sounding jealous] But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.Like, \"let\\'s-not-tell-my-husband\" unspoken. [becoming aggressive] Sure, but were we married when you two were \"stranded\" on Delphi 6 for three days?Because I sensed something was weird when you can back.But what do I know about sensitivity?I\\'m just a phantom train conductor.You\\'re the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!

Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake!They\\'re first line of defense against evil!They\\'re the guardians of the unguarded! I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.[holds up a \"Morty Adventure Card\" with ten squares and all but one containing a Morty-shaped stamp mark] Read \\'em and weep. Rick! Rick, stop! Whoa, yeah! You mean \"two for two\", right, Vance? So, this is... Vindicators 3?And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us? We weren\\'t here \"last time\", remember?They did a whole Vindicators without us.A bunch of them got killed, too.Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there. I... think the personality conflict might have been... you. Rick, since it\\'s my adventure and all, could you do me a favor? Rick, this really bums me out.It-It\\'s embarrassing to find out these guys don\\'t like us. Yeah, but not heroes. [sigh] I-I totally get it.I-I\\'m so sorry. [tongue-tied] I-I-I...I\\'m not a superhero. Rick says \"good\" and \"bad\" are artificial constructs. [annoyed] Get it yourself. Just focus on the mission, all right? Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender!We can\\'t leave now! Guys![finishes placing the cards underneath the pictures] I\\'ve figured it out. That\\'s not the issue, Rick! Uh, what happened on Dorian 5? W-Wait, huh? [with annoyed realization] Oh, o-okay.This again? I-It\\'s just something Rick starts talking about whenever he\\'s blackout drunk. In a way that has no point!You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out! [sigh] You guys hit the baskets.I\\'ll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.There\\'s a 40% chance it\\'s a dud, but y-you should still stay back. [angrily] Too many, Rick!Too many! You always put it in the weirdest place!Um, uh, over here, maybe? Oh, I don\\'t know.I appreciate it, Morty.I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators\\' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit. Yeah, it is.You know why, Rick?Because when you\\'re an asshole, it doesn\\'t matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction. [with realization] Holy shit.You\\'re jealous.Is that what you want to hear?! Guys, stop!You\\'re just proving my asshole grandpa right! I think... no matter what we put on there, we die.he said it\\'s the part of the Vindicators he values.That means nothing.He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave. What? [smiling smuglystarting walking toward the platform] I\\'ll cover that bet.I get it. [getting angry] ...Motherfucker! Shut up. [gagging] Greater good?! Never said that! No doubt.Who do we make the check out to? Right? But.. she was trying to kill us! Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom.Which is why we don\\'t need jackets.[takes his jacket off] And I\\'m pretty sure we don\\'t need Vindicators.', 'Rick': ' Great.Next time I need a species sterilized, who\\'s gonna do it for me?You?I-Is that the Vindibeacon?We\\'re being called to assemble by the Vindicators! I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty.Let it go to voicemail! They\\'re the writers of their own press releases, Morty!They\\'re a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up.They\\'re a phase.We did one, it was the big event of that summer.Let it die. God... fuckin\\' dammit![takes the card] Fine!But don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.[presses a button on the Vindibeacon and speaks into it] Vindicator command ship, beacon received!We\\'re doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm. Oh, that\\'s Million Ants.I can\\'t see the ants over here.It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man.Wiggly Turd Man. Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.[points to Crocubot] Um, this guy.The, uh... [laughs] Right, Crocubot.So, you\\'re half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine. So, you\\'re origin is what?Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy? Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses.Ability to do anything...But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me. Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman.After his parents\\' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains.It\\'s not all bad, though.They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle! Thanks, Noob-Noob!This guy gets it.It was happy hour. Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause. Did he say he never forgets a kid? Don\\'t worry, Morty, they love you.Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it\\'s mind-blowing. [spits] Jesus... How awesome is that?I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back? Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty.Me sleeping on these linens is the favor.I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating?Comfort? Why?Morty, [burp] I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week. Oh, please.They\\'re my heroes!Mine!I\\'m gonna go get a drink.Ship has arrived at Terraneus system.All Vindicators report to the... briefing room.The--The room from the, uh... the...Uh, it\\'s the d--It\\'s a different room than--than... conference room.I\\'m sorry, it\\'s my first day as a PA system.First day jitters. Barely. Uh-huh. Hey, I can\\'t help if I can\\'t see. Really?You don\\'t say.You would have used a ghost train?[sarcastic] Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train! Is there coffee?Hey, Morty, can you be a pal?Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship.Y-You know, the French press thing? [sarcastic] Oh, oh, oh, I\\'m sorry.Oh, you\\'re right.Ooh, real serious.Gotta take it real serious, huh?They\\'re all dead! [still sarcastic] Ooh, real scared.Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here. Million Ants, ladies and gentleman!The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!Short mission, good mission.Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train?See you guys in Vindicators 4.Morty? Well, have fun with that.But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour. Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout. Look, I\\'m a lit--[burp] little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I\\'ve always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours. Morty I\\'m a drunk, not a hack. [embarrassed] Well, I-I-I think we\\'ve seen enough.I\\'ll just figure out how to unplug this.The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves?Do you know yourselves?Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it\\'s a matching thing.And do it in three minutes, or you\\'ll [burp] all die.I\\'m not playing his game.I\\'m gonna find us a way out of here. Whoa, whoa, whoa.Hold on, Vance.He said you\\'d die if you tried to leave.That means there\\'s booby traps. What part of \"blackout\" don\\'t you understand?I thought you drank? Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh. Alan, I\\'m not proud of what\\'s happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there\\'s gonna be another passenger on that ghost train. Uh, I kind of am.I saved the goddamn universe. Ahh, it would\\'ve been if I hadn\\'t.Dorian 5! W-What?In w--In w-w-what--In what way?Like, w-w-what\\'s my point? So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place. I don\\'t either.You do you.But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.[cough] I\\'m so fucking drunk.Ugh, okay, here\\'s the deal.I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit.I\\'m--I\\'m not going to sleep.I just... just need to rest my eye, so let\\'s make this one simple.Just try to hit some three-pointers.And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something.Also, Hawaii. Man, I am really getting high-roaded today. Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb.it\\'s a miracle I actually every destroy anything. I know.Everyone wants people they like to be right.That\\'s why popular people are fucking dumb.And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.[the bomb powers down] Disarmed. Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.But... you do have one thing I\\'ll never have.And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me.if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode.And probably the solar system, \\'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one. I could--It could be Morty. Hey, I don\\'t know.I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there\\'s no logic to it.it\\'s, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying \"Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I\\'ll kill you.\" Look, I... there\\'s nothing in the room but us.I\\'m just using logic to connect some dots.It\\'s the best guess I\\'ve got. Well, Morty, I think you\\'re making that smirky face because you\\'re misinterpreting the moment.I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.It looks like I\\'m never gonna see you again.I can\\'t really roll with the hero types, and I don\\'t... th-they don\\'t want me around.But I want... you to know, even if I didn\\'t show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.It makes no sense.Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass.Even my own grandson is like, \"Oh, the Vindicators are so cool.\"I mean, he\\'s a moron, it\\'s their... demographic.But you\\'re different, Noob-Noob. [also gagging] Titty-Bean? [sarcastic] Yeah, I feel safer already. I\\'ll say, we are gettin\\' some good licks in while choking to death. Ah, who cares? Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week.I end up getting high with half of \\'em.I mean, check it out, Gear Head\\'s here.Well, that\\'s gonna shoot through me. Shut up, Summer. Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?', 'Supernova': \" ...the Terraneus system.Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base. Rick, you have something to add to the briefing? Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing![to Rick] If I can continue, Rick.I anticipate sophisticated security measures.I trust you can be of service there. Good morning.Looks like your grandpa had a long night.Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can... [sigh] clean up his diarrhea. Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission. Vindicators, prepare for arrival. Star Mother, grant me your wrath![goes back and faces the team] Gun turret. Are you all right? Someone wake up Sanchez. Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret.Can you bring it offline? RICK! It's Worldender!What happened to him? He's right.This is far from over. Obviously?You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it?That's something obvious to you? Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.Then, we'll deal with the two of you.[to Rick] I hope you're proud of yourself! Goddammit! Nothing! Doomnomitron was hiding here!He's a shapeshifter!Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him! I'm not the one that didn't want you back.Alan was! [growing sad] You wish this was about sex!We loved each other!We had a child together. [crying] I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR!And yes, he was better than you! Is that sarcasm?![conjures handcuffs onto Rick and Morty] I don't want you slipping away then this is over!All of these deaths are on your hands! So what's the trick?Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert. Jesus!Okay, open to second opinions! But you're betting our lives on it. Not all of us. Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles.It's for the greater good. It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure! You were always the romantic.[sinister] Which is why you can't leave either.She double-crossed Snuzzles!\", 'The, uh...\\nCrocubot': ' I am Crocubot.', 'Crocubot': \" Yes. Why would Worldender do this to his own men... and several women? [swiping through the map] There's no other possible answer.My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it.\", 'Noob-Noob': ' [sweeping up in the background; snickers] Got damn! Got damn! [slips on some diarrhea] Ohh!No, uh, I...I got stuff to do here.', 'Alan': ' I wish he had the ability to check is attitude. I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back! Nothing?!We exterminated a planet! Nice shot. You two make quite a team. Yeah, I guess. [sounding jealous] But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.Like, \"let\\'s-not-tell-my-husband\" unspoken. [becoming aggressive] Sure, but were we married when you two were \"stranded\" on Delphi 6 for three days?Because I sensed something was weird when you can back.But what do I know about sensitivity?I\\'m just a phantom train conductor.You\\'re the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife! Did it feel good?!Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?! WHAT?! Yeah? ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!Didn\\'t see that comin\\'.', 'Vance': \" Rick Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror.Man, that's hard to say.And... Morty, right? I never forget a kid.[to everyone] What do you say, Vindicators?Let's make this three for three? Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.Pretty toothless stuff, guys.These guys are even lamer than last time. You should be.[opens a locker, takes out a blue Vindicator vest and tosses it to Morty] Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you're not one of us?Disgraceful. Cop a squat, chief.[they sit down] Everyone in the universe is a hero.All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good. Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.[to Noob-Noob] Not coming, Noob-Noob? Well, he is the Worldender.The guy ends worlds.Kind of his thing. Why are you acting like that's not you?! Like cool drinking!Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!I need space.I-I need SPACE!FROM THIS!\", 'Million Ants': \" [beat] I sense... insecurity. Yes.I only lost 400 ants.My queen is laying more.[his holes are now gone] I am back to one million ants. I sense the presence of a greater evil.Okay, is it recording?Good.Hello, Vindicators.Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!I had too much to drink last night.What's going on, buddy? I have no stake in this. Thank you. [morphs into a larger attack form] One million times better! That is a... really specific guess. Titty-Bean, listen to me.When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants.It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man. Who knows?But we can make it simple again.\", 'Drunk Rick': ' ...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game.Are you seriously \"Saw\"-ing the Vindicators? If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die.Like in [burp] \"Sawwww\". Congrats!You did it--[burp] it!All of the descriptors apply to all of you.Drunk Rick\\'s point is that none of you are very special or different.[despondent] That\\'s always his point.
